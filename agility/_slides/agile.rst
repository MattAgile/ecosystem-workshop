    .. revealjs:: Agile software development

        Agile software development describes a set of values and principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams.[1] It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.[2] These principles support the definition and continuing evolution of many software development methods.[3]

        The term agile (sometimes written Agile)[4] was popularized by the Manifesto for agile software development,[5] which defines those values and principles. Agile software development frameworks continue to evolve,[3] two of the most widely used being Scrum and Kanban.[6]

        Iterative and incremental software development methods can be traced back to 1957.[7] Evolutionary project management[8][9] and adaptive software development[10] emerged in the early 1970s. During the 1990s, a number of lightweight software development methods evolved in reaction to the prevailing heavyweight methods that critics described as heavily regulated, planned, and micro-managed. These included: from 1991, rapid application development;[11][12] from 1994, the unified process and dynamic systems development method (DSDM); from 1995, Scrum; from 1996, Crystal Clear and extreme programming (XP); and from 1997, feature-driven development. Although these originated before the publication of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, they are collectively referred to as agile software development methods.[3] At the same time, similar changes were underway in manufacturing[13] and aerospace.[14]

        In 2001, seventeen software developers met at the Snowbird resort in Utah to discuss these lightweight development methods, among others Jeff Sutherland, Ken Schwaber, and Alistair Cockburn. Together they published the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.[5]

        In 2005, a group headed by Alistair Cockburn and Jim Highsmith wrote an addendum of project management principles, the Declaration of Interdependence,[15] to guide software project management according to agile software development methods.

        In 2009, a movement by Robert C Martin wrote an extension of software development principles, the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto, to guide agile software development according to professional conduct and mastery.

        In 2011 the Agile Alliance created the Guide to Agile Practices (renamed the Agile Glossary in 2016),[16] an evolving open-source compendium of the working definitions of agile practices, terms, and elements, along with interpretations and experience guidelines from the worldwide community of agile practitioners.
