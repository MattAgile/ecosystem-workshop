.. revealjs:: Scrum

    Scrum is a framework for managing software development. It is designed for teams of three to nine developers who break their work into actions that can be completed within fixed duration cycles (called "sprints"), track progress and re-plan in daily 15-minute stand-up meetings, and collaborate to deliver workable software every sprint.[1][2] Approaches to coordinating the work of multiple scrum teams in larger organizations include Large-Scale Scrum, Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) and Scrum of Scrums, among others.

    .. revealjs:: Key ideas

        Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development.[3][4] It defines "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal",[5] challenges assumptions of the "traditional, sequential approach"[5] to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines involved.

        A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change their minds about what they want or need (often called requirements volatility[6]) and that there will be unpredictable challenges—for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. As such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.

        Note on capitalization Many of the terms used in Scrum (e.g., scrum master) are typically written with leading capitals (i.e., Scrum Master) or as conjoint words written in camel case (i.e., ScrumMaster). To maintain an encyclopedic approach, however, this article uses normal sentence case for these terms—unless they are recognized marks (such as Certified Scrum Master).

        While the trademark on the term Scrum itself has been allowed to lapse, so that it is deemed as owned by the wider community rather than an individual,[7] the leading capital is retained—except when used with other words (as in daily scrum or scrum team).

        In the literature, this is occasionally seen in all capitals, as SCRUM.[8] While this is incorrect, as Scrum is not an acronym, it likely arose due to an early paper by Ken Schwaber which capitalized SCRUM in the title.[1][9]
